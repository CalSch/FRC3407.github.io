## Software Resources
### VS Code Setup
VS code is the recommended development environment for software development.  It acts as a program to check out the code, make edits, and build the project in one place.
You can find instructions for installation on Windows here:

- [VS Code and WPILib Install Instructions](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)
- [FRC Tools for VS Code Download](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html)

### 3407 Team Github
[3407 Public Github](https://github.com/FRC3407)
- Note:  Any competition code should be saved on the team github under it's own repository

### Java Resources
Currently, Java is the main coding language used, though Labview has been suggested in the past.
